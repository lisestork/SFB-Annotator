### **Annotation notes:**
Field notes are collections of observation records ([`dwc:HumanObservation`](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/HumanObservation)) that describe the occurrence ([`dwc:Occurrence`](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Occurrence)) of an organism ([`dwc:Organism`](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Organism)) at a certain location ([`dwc:Location`](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Location)) and date ([`nhc:Date`](http://makingsense.liacs.nl/rdf/nhc-content/2018-04-04.html#Date)). An observation record most often includes  an identification ([`dwc:Identification`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:Identification)) to a taxon ([`dwc:Taxon`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:Taxon)), and accompanying measurements and facts (`dwc:MeasurementOrFact`, `UBERON_0001062`, `ncit:C20189`) that were used for identification. These observation records usually span multiple field notes, but can also be very short utterances such as on page 3: _Sci. Diard Buitenzorg_, most likely referring to the occurrence of another organism with the same identification.

The different variations for annotation are:

* Fill in the pop-up form/table:

|Key|Value |Notes | Diff Expected

| Select property | `Organism identification to` | The annotation of an entity that refers to the identification of an organism (a taxon name as the initialisation of a field observation record, usually a new genus or scientificName). |
| type | `taxon` | auto-fill from entity type |
| Belongs to taxon | `https://identifiers.org/taxonomy:9397` | refers to _Chiroptera_ (order) in NCBI Taxonomy.

| Organism ID | `1` | Maps to [`dwc:organismID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:occurrenceID).

It allows all information belonging to the occurrence or organism observation to be linked together. Hence, how will we enforce this in the backend?

\* In the absence of a persistent global unique identifier, construct one from a combination of identifiers in the record that will most closely make the ID globally unique. Examples: http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm:233627, 000866d2-c177-4648-a200-ead4007051b9, urn:catalog:UWBM:Bird:89776

| language | _la_ | [ISO code](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) for _latin_ | add autocomplete/drop down menu
| Select property | `Additional identification to` | The annotation of an entity that refers to an _additional_ (secondary) identification of an organism (a scientific name as the initialisation of a field observation record). Usually, this is a second identification performed at a later stage (with availability of more knowledge for identification). Within this field note, the organism is first identified `in the field' as a new taxon _Gymnonotus_. |
| type | `taxon` | auto-fill from entity type |
| Belongs to taxon | `https://identifiers.org/taxonomy:9397` | refers to _Chiroptera_ (order) in NCBI Taxonomy. Choice should be made whether this can be an IRI from an external database, or whether it should point to an already annotated verbatim entity. (such as _Chiroptera_ on page 2) (question: who do we allow to annotate, and who to interpret the data) |
| Taxon rank | `genus` | from list (`kingdom`,`class`,`order`,`family`,`genus`, `specificEpithet`, `scientificName`)|
| Identified by | | Corresponds to meaning of [`dwc:identifiedBy`](`https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:identifiedBy`) (people, groups, or organizations who assigned the Taxon to the subject). Preferably enter an instance of the class `foaf:Person` (or organization). _Pteropus_ is most likely added at a later stage; therefore, we do not know (for sure) who performed the identification.  |
| Organism ID | `2` | Matches to [`dwc:organismID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:occurrenceID). Should be generated automatically. `2` is a placeholder; an unique ID should be generated for the organism record.\*| This additional identification should refer to the same organism ID as the first identification (`dsw:hasIdentification`). **important note**: when is this organism and possibly also occurrence ID generated? It allows all information belonging to the occurrence or organism observation to be linked together. Hence, how will we enforce this in the backend?
| Occurrence ID | `1` | Maps to [`dwc:occurrenceID`](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:occurrenceID). Should be generated automatically. `1` is a placeholder; some unique ID should be generated for the organism record.\* | Should potentially be removed, or should be the same as the occurrence ID generated for the first identification, as it is based on information from the same organism occurrence. Right now, the pop-up table for example_1_2 does not prompt for occurrenceID.

**Remarks:** Triples not generated. Output should be similar to output of [`example_1_2.ttl`](/data/rdf/example_1_2.ttl), but `dsw:hasIdentification` should be replaced with `nhc:additionalIdentification`, and the additional identification should refer to the same organism ID as the first identification (`dsw:hasIdentification`).

See [`example_7_2.ttl`](/data/rdf/example_7_2.ttl) file.

\* For the `rdf:type` variant of `nhc:Date`, the fields should be the same, only omitting the field `organism ID`.

**General notes:**

* (back-end) Most annotations (except for variety 1, a class annotation) link to an annotation record, and atm, some annotations therefore depend on the prior annotation of other named entities. However, these annotation events should be able to occur un any order and the code should reflect this.  

* (relates to front-end) The entity type field should produce a drop-down menu with the possible classes  (`taxon`, `person`, `location`, `date`, `anatomical entity`, `measurementOrFact`) rather than a free-text field. Similarly, the entry to this field should limit the number of possibilities for the `select property` field. (E.g., `person` -> `Type`, `Author of scientific name`, `Organism identified by`, `Occurrence recorded by`/`Additional Occurrence recorded by`)
